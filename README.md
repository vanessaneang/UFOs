# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
In this module we helped client by creating a webpage and dynamic table that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Once the user fills out the filter search container a table will auto-generate with the UFO data that fits the criteria.

## Results:
Users will be directed to the following page as seen below:

Once users scroll down they will come across the data table and they will see all the data entries of noted UFO sightings. The table is organized into several columns: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments.

The noticeable part of the data table is the filter search table where the user is able to enter different criteria to filter the table. There are four different filters the user can choose from, they can pick one or more filters and the data table will generate with the filtered data. The greyed out text in each box are sample filters to demonstrate to the user how to fill out the search filter. Once the user fills out the search box the most important part is to click anywhere on the the webpage in order for the page to read the filters.

As an example the date "01/12/2010" and shape "other" was entered, the image below is the results from the filtered table.

## Summary:
The drawbacks for this page is the case sensitivity for the filters and the users not knowing all the options for each filter. An update for the code would be to include dropdown menus with all the options for each filter and/or offer autocomplete text function when the user fills out the filter. This will offer the site more user-friendly useability and create less user error when trying to filter out the data. Another option to add to the page would be add a button for users to click once they are done filling out the filter search boxes, this gives the webpage more user-friendly avenues to prevent errors and increase user satisfaction.
